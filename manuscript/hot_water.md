## Hot Water

Fundamental for drinks and food: having hot water available is at the core of the Eco Travel kitchen.

With hot water, you can prepare tea and coffee. You can also prepare (I don't want to say "cook") porridge, instant noodles, instant soup, boiled eggs, taboule and other instant meals. You can also use it to wash dishes and to wash your hair.

You can prepare and carry hot water in a any mode of transportation: on foot, and even easier in a vehicle.

Boiling water requires quite some energy (200 Wh per liter, see chapter on [Energy](#energy)). Therefore it is best to keep hot water, that you do not use immediately, in a thermos.
