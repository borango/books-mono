# Store Food

This section is derived from [Permaculture principle #2 Catch and Store Resources](#pp02).

In this book I am dividing storage of *food* from all other resources (water and energy).

This section here is about the *food* resources: your pantry.

My logic for storing food is:

1. most of my food shall keep for a long time without refrigeration

1. meals from stored food shall be easy or quick to prepare

1. preparing these meals shall be efficient in the usage of water and energy 

1. most stored food items shall be useful in a larger number of recipes

The longer food keeps, the less frequently you need to stop sailing and re-stock your supplies. This increases autonomy.

Quick and easy preparation is fundamental when you are sailing short-handed or in high seas.

Efficient use of energy and water also increases autonomy because it does not deplete these resources as quickly. Cooking pasta and wasting liters of hot water is contrary to my logic. You can fix that by substituting pasta with rice (absorbs all water), or by cooking one-pot-pasta (no excess water).

Mostly I avoid one-trick-ponys in my pantry. This way I can create a larger variety of dishes from a smaller number of different ingredients. This increases diversity in my menu.

Of course the food shall be healthy, responsibly sourced and delicious. These properties are somewhat subject to opinion or personal taste, so the composition of your pantry will be a different one. The purpose of my compilation is to demonstrate a system, or logic, between the catch / store and cook / eat topics.

I further separate my food inventory list into long-term storage (keeps for years) and mid-term storage (keeps for weeks). 

On top, short-term storage is always improvised and a matter of availability (shops at land). Short-term storage is not strategic for the planning and for the goals of Eco Sailing. So yes, I do enjoy bread, butter and cheese - I just don't count on it. That's why I don't cover it in the storage section.

## Mid Term Storage

Items in mid-term storage I can re-stock every week or two. Ideally sourced from local farmers, otherwise from groceries.

### Potatoes

Offers a wide range of different end results (recipes). Surprisingly low in calories.

Used raw in: RÃ¶sti, [Tortilla Espanol](#tortilla-espanol) and Tajine. Used as boiled potatoes in: Fried Potatoes and Potatoe Salad

Also as the side dish for a million of other recipes (which I don't cook).

I boil them in seawater in a solar stove, for example on a sunny afternoon. Then I can decide later on the meal that I want to prepare quickly from boiled potatoes.

### Onions

High in vitamin C. Depending on preparation, can taste soft, crisp, crunchy, sour, sweet or roasted.

I like to fry them quickly in a pan, then add them to many salads or meals.

Used in: [Tortilla Espanol](#tortilla-espanol), Rice Tika Masala and Fried Potatoes, and optionally in Omelette, One-Pot-Pasta, Potatoe Salad and Tajine.

### Garlic 

The little brother of onions. Keeps even longer, but not as versatile as onions in its use in recipes. Somewhere between *ingredient* and *spice* that you can add to almost anything. Special appearance
in Pasta Alio & Olio.

### Eggs

Depending on climate somewhere between short-term and mid-term storage.

Used in: Omelette, [Tortilla Espanol](#tortilla-espanol) and Tamago.


## Long Term Storage

Items in long-term storage I can store in bulk sizes (packs of kilograms or larger), and I need to re-stock only once per year, in theory. Typically I rotate my stock and re-supply smaller quantities after I consumed them.

### Oatmeal

Used in: [Porridge](#porridge) mainly. Can substitue wheat flour to a certain degree, and added to Omelette surprisingly.

### Sunflower Seeds

Used in: Porridge, and for the [quickest snacks](#trail-mix) (without cooking) together with raisins, or just plain.

### Raisins

My main source for (culinary) sweetness.

Used in: Porridge, and for the quickest snacks (without cooking) together with sunflower seeds or peanut butter.

### Peanut Butter

Admittedly not the highest quality of vegetable oil, but so versatile and easy to process (mostly without coooking).

I use it as the quickest snack with raisins, for example when sailing single-handed.

Can serve as spread on bread, can be added to Porridge, Salad, and almost any other recipe.

### Mustard

Solid basis for vinaigrette (salad dressing) and an allround addition to many dishes. Special appearance in Seaweed Salad. Also keeps relatively well when opened.

### Vinager

The standard for vinaigrette (salad dressing). Indispensable for (Cole) Slaw.

Can also be used for general cleaning and sterilization, and for removing corrosion from copper cable (mix with salt).

### Mung Beans

For sprouting. Creates a fresh and green plant from long-term storage dry beans, within 24 hours. Ingenious trick of nature. I sprout them every day and add them to almost any meal, including Porridge.

### Rice

The fundamental cereal, and the "more sustainable" alternative to pasta because rice naturally absorbs all and exactly the water that you cook it in.

Used in Rice Tika Masala, and in the Japanese Tamago for a fast and delicious snack.

And of course as the side dish for a million of other recipes (which I don't cook).

### Pasta

Well, the standard. I suggest to cook only as One-Pot-Pasta, not to waste water and energy. See [Rice](#rice) as the more efficient alternative.

### Ramen Kit

Somewhere between rice, pasta and soup.

### Mayonnaise

An amazingly fresh tasting, long keeping food (while closed of course).

Used in [Potato Salad](#potato-salad) as the second main ingredient. Also can substitute butter as a spread on bread.

### Olive Oil

My main and only vegetable oil for cooking.

### Falafel Mix

I admit, this is a one-trick pony. Can only produce Falafel. Mentioned here as an example and proxy for other ready mixes that I can cook or fry in the pan.

### Soy Sauce

Alternative to vinaigrette, or as a dip for fresh vegetables (cucumber, carrots, zucchini/courgette).

Easiest sauce to eat with rice, or more sophisticated as Tamago.
