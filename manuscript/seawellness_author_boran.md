## About the author

Rock climber, paragliding pilot, sailor and engineer.

Full-time traveller since 2020, between the Arctic circle and the Sahara desert, by car or on sailboats.

Boran experienced his share of vertigo and motionsickness while practicing gymnastics, rockclimbing, king swings and sailing. By no means born without motionsickness, Boran has found and mastered techniques for overcoming these uneasy feelings in methodical ways. Since then, Boran enjoys flying and sailing virtually free from seasickness symptoms.

Also loves people, dogs and nature.

Believes in freedom and peace.
