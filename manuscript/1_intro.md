## What is Eco Sailing? <!-- H2 Obs style: the only TOC elements; leanpub style: chapter sections -->

the Sailing flavour of Eco Travel:

Using a sailboat for habitation, recreation, or transportation without polluting the environment and without consuming resources beyond a fair share.

Eco Sailing means moving at sea and near the shore in such a way that is environmentally friendly, socially responsible, and economically *sustainable*.


*Sustainable* means lasting a long time, like *going forever* without harming the environment, society or yourself. It is a way of living and travelling while consuming only a *fair share* and without depleting resources.

Most readers of this book have sorted their residential life already in a sustainable way. You separate your waste, you recycle, you compost, you eat less meat, you buy local products, you use more public transportation, you avoid plastic and so on. You have established a budget which balances income and expenses. You are already living a sustainable life at home.

In financial terms, sustainability means that I can travel longer or infinite if I do not spend more than I earn. Travelling on a low budget is not a choice or a goal by itself but a consequence of the choice to travel longer or indefinitely.

## Systemic approach

Eco Travel is a system. A system of choices, habits, procedures and equipment that satisfies your needs and your aspirations. A system within a geographical, climatic and cultural context.

Typically the system will evolve, based on changing opportunities and constraints, new priorities in needs, revisited choices, adjusted procedures and upgraded equipment. Habits will both begin the evolution (begin with what you like to do), and some changed or new habits will be the result of the evolution. Often the result will tend towards a simpler and happier version of your life.

## Habits

Eco Sailing is different from a typical residential life, and different from mainstream yacht sailing. The biggest difference is the choice for sustainable resources at very limited capacity. 

You may be living a very sustainable life on land, yet you have virtually unlimited supplies of water, electricity and food at home. Plus more space and the chance to grow your own food. The difference here is capacity.

Or you may be a seasoned sailor, used to a yacht with a big engine, large fuel tanks, a watermaker, a generator, air conditioning and a freezer. The difference here is the priority for sustainability. 

Old habits are hard to break. I do not expect many readers from the established sailing community to give up their high standard of comfort and convenience. On my personal sailing journey, it was mostly eco-friendly people on land, and sailors on very small boats, whe were interested in the Eco solutions that I am using.

From whatever background you come, Eco Sailing likely requires new habits. Living with limited resources, slower, simpler. These habits are related to a more conscious every-day life, more connected to nature and on a smaller budget, which could be considered motiviations on their own, or intermediate steps towards a happier life in greater freedom.

Whatever perspective you have on sailing: in this book I will tell you everything about the hacks and systems that I have successfully applied on two sailboats. By Eco Sailing I have travelled from the Baltic Sea to Gibraltar. I heard that my story inspires people, so I want to inspire and encourage you all to get on board and live your dreams.

## Book Structure

Sailing, ecology and sustainability go together hand in hand. [^n1]

[^n1]: Not necessarily sailing a modern, overpowered yacht that offers 4-star comfort and hops from marina to marina, refilling fuel and water tanks and connecting to shore power as soon as they can. Here I am writing about a sailing lifestyle which is closer to camping in terms of comfort, and similar to living in an offgrid tiny house.

Many aspects of Eco Sailing remind me of [Permaculture](#permaculture), which is why the first four chapters of this book are based on major permaculture principles: 

1. Use Renewable Resources
1. Catch Resources 
1. Store Resources *and*
1. Store Food

These chapters list procedures and equipment which are tightly related with each other and form a logical group.

The chapter [Cooking and Eating](#cook-eat) is dedicated to fulfilling the basic human need, ideally not only to survive, but to enjoy as well. Chapters 1-4 build the foundation that culminates, on one side, in cooking and eating.

On the other side, chapters 1-3 are the foundation for mechanical and electric energy, which pushes the boat and powers vital equipment. The electrical side I cover in chapter Electro Backbone. 

The mechanical and procedural aspects I cover in the two chapters on Sailing and Anchoring.

Finally, autonomy can reach a limit. The chapter on Infrastructure discusses how we connect to zivilization, from time to time, for supplies, repairs, social contacts and so on.

Remaining chapters mainly list in tabular form and reference all Eco Sailing components by type. Because Equipment, Choices, Procedures and Habits are discussed and dispersed throughout the book, these lists give you summarized overviews.

I find it difficult to present a larger system of interrelated topics in a linear way, like in this book. 

Most concepts form shorter or longer causal chains, such as: 

![sails catch wind, generate propulsion](vec/wind-sails-propulsion.svg)

And also at other times:

![turbine catches wind...](vec/wind-turbine-propulsion.svg)

The bigger, more accurate picture is:

![turbine and sails catch wind...](vec/wind-sails-and-turbine.svg)


So I chose to list Wind in chapter 1, Sails and the Wind Turbine (and all the other resource catchers) in chapter 2, the battery in chapter 3 and Propulsion in the Sailing chapter.

I am using many cross-references in the electronic versions of this book. They represent the green lines in the diagrams above. This way you can follow a causal chain from Wind, Turbine, ... , to Propulsion (and back) if you want to. Otherwise you just keep reading about logical groups of subjects, chapter by chapter.
