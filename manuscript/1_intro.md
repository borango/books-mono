## What do we call Eco Travel? <!-- H2 Obs style: the only TOC elements; leanpub style: chapter sections -->

Eco Travel means moving from A to B in a way which is environmentally friendly, socially responsible, and economically sustainable.

You can travel by many means of transportation. For the purpose of this book, we will focus on the following:
1. on foot (backpacking)
1. by car
1. by boat

... and show you how we did it in the best possible "eco" way.

We will tell you everything about the hacks and simple systems that we created and applied on our journeys. We have heard that our stories inspire people, so we want to inspire and encourage you all to live your dreams...

Compared to residential life (in a house or home), traveling means to limit the stuff that I can take with me. In that sense, we traveling by car is more limited and hardcore than traveling by boat, and backpacking is more hardcore than traveling by car.

Understanding your needs, developing new habits, inventing procedures and discovering external resources along along your way are keys to successful eco travel.
