## What is Eco Sailing? <!-- H2 Obs style: the only TOC elements; leanpub style: chapter sections -->

the Sailing flavour of Eco Travel:

Using a sailboat for habitation, recreation, or transportation without polluting the environment and without consuming resources beyond a fair share.

Eco Sailing means moving at sea and near the shore in such a way that is environmentally friendly, socially responsible, and economically sustainable.


### Sustainability

*Sustainable* means lasting a long time, like *going forever* without harming the environment, society or yourself. It is a way of living and traveling that does not deplete resources while consuming only a *fair share*.

Most readers of this book have sorted their residential life already in a sustainable way. You separate your waste, you recycle, you compost, you eat less meat, you buy local products, you use more public transportation, you avoid plastic and so on. You have established a budget which balances income and expenses. You are already living a sustainable life at home.

In financial terms, sustainability means that I can travel longer or infinite if I do not spend more than I earn. Travelling on a low budget is not a choice or a goal by itself but a consequence of the choice to travel longer or indefinitely.

### Systemic approach

Eco Travel is a system. A system of needs, choices, habits, procedures and equipment. A system within a geographical, climatic and cultural context.

Typically the system will evolve, based on changing opportunities and constraints, new priorities in needs, revisited choices, adjusted procedures and upgraded equipment. Habits will both begin the evolution (begin with what you like to do), and some changed or new habits will be the result of the evolution. Often the result will tend towards a simpler and happier version of your life.

In this book I will tell you everything about the hacks and systems that I have applied on two sailboats that I had converted to Eco Sailing. I heard that my story inspires people, so I want to inspire and encourage you all to get on board and live your dreams.

## About this Book

Sailing, ecology and sustainability go together hand in hand. Not necessarily sailing a modern, overpowered yacht that offers 4-star comfort and hops from marina to marina, refilling fuel and water tanks and connecting to shore power as soon as they can.

I am writing about a sailing lifestyle which is closer to camping in terms of comfort, and similar to living in an offgrid tiny house.

### Book Structure

Many aspects of Eco Sailing remind me of [Permaculture](#permaculture), which is why 4 sections of this book are based on major permaculture principles: using renewable resources, catching resources and storing resources.
