## What do we call Eco Sailing? <!-- H2 Obs style: the only TOC elements; leanpub style: chapter sections -->

Using a sailboat for habitation, recreation, or transportation without polluting the environment and without consuming resources beyond a fair share.

Eco Sailing means moving at sea and near the shore in such a way that is environmentally friendly, socially responsible, and economically sustainable.


### Sustainability

*Sustainable* means lasting a long time, like *going forever* without harming the environment, society or myself. It is a way of living and traveling that does not deplete resources while consuming a *fair share*.

Most readers of this book have sorted their residential life already in a sustainable way. You separate your waste, you recycle, you compost, you eat less meat, you buy local products, you use more public transportation, you avoid plastic and so on. You have established a budget which balances income and expenses. You are already living a sustainable life at home.

In financial terms, sustainability means that I can travel longer or infinite if I do not spend more than I earn. Travelling on a low budget is not a choice or a goal by itself but a consequence of the choice to travel longer or indefinitely.

### Systemic approach

Eco Travel is a system. A system of needs, choices, procedures, equipment and habits. A system within a geographical, climatic and cultural context.

Typically the system will evolve, based on changing opportunities and constraints, new priorities in needs, adjusted choices, better procedures and different equipment. Habits will both begin the evolution (begin with what you like to do), and some changed or new habits will be the result of the evolution.

Understanding your needs, developing new habits, inventing procedures and discovering external resources along along your way are keys to successful Eco Travel.

In this book we will tell you everything about the hacks and simple systems that we created and applied on our journeys. We have heard that our stories inspire people, so we want to inspire and encourage you all to live your dreams and build your own Eco Travel system.
