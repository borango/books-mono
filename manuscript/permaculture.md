# Permaculture

While invented in a farming context, the principles of permaculture can be applied to many areas of life, including Eco Travel. In fact, Eco Tavel and Permaculture align with each other very well.

Below is a table that outlines the 12 principles of permaculture and how they can be adapted for travelling.

Our thoughts here are not designed to teach permaculture. If you are familiar with permaculture already, you may find these principles useful for thinking about how to travel in a more sustainable way.

| # | Principle Name | Definition (Farming Context) | Transfer to Eco Travel |
|---|----------------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | Observe and Interact | Carefully observe natural systems to design solutions that work with the environment.| Learn about destinations, adapt to local customs, and travel thoughtfully to respect environments. |
| 2 | Catch and Store Energy | Harness renewable energy (e.g., solar, wind) to meet needs sustainably.| (same) |
| 3 | Obtain a Yield | Ensure systems produce tangible benefits, like food or resources, to sustain the farm.| Seek meaningful travel experiences, like learning local skills or supporting eco-projects. |
| 4 | Apply Self-Regulation | Limit resource use and accept feedback to avoid overexploitation or harm.| Travel mindfully, limit consumption (e.g., water, fuel), and adjust based on local conditions. |
| 5 | Use Renewable Resources | Prioritize renewable materials and energy to reduce dependency on finite resources.| Choose eco-friendly transport (biking, sailing) and accommodations using renewable energy. |
| 6 | Produce No Waste | Design systems where all outputs are reused or recycled, minimizing waste.| Pack out trash, avoid single-use plastics, and pick destinations with recycling options. |
| 7 | Design from Patterns to Details | Use natural patterns (e.g., water flow, seasons) to guide farm design before focusing on specifics. | Plan travel routes based on natural or cultural patterns, like seasonal events or local trails. |
| 8 | Integrate Rather than Segregate | Create systems where elements work together, like plants and animals, for mutual benefit.| Connect with locals, join community activities, or stay in shared, sustainable accommodations. |
| 9 | Use Small and Slow Solutions | Start with small, manageable systems that evolve naturally over time.| Travel slowly, stay longer in one place to connect deeply, and reduce your footprint. |
|10 | Use and Value Diversity | Incorporate diverse plants, animals, and methods to build resilient systems.| Explore diverse cultures and ecosystems, supporting varied local businesses and practices. |
|11 | Use Edges and Value the Marginal | Leverage boundaries (e.g., forest edges) where diverse ecosystems create unique opportunities.| Visit lesser-known destinations or "edge" places (e.g., coastal villages) for unique experiences. |
|12 | Creatively Use and Respond to Change | Adapt to environmental or social changes with creative, flexible solutions.| Be flexible with travel plans, adapt to local changes (e.g., weather, customs), and embrace spontaneity. |
