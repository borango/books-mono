# Permaculture

While invented in a farming context, the principles of permaculture can be applied to many areas of life, including Eco Travel. In fact, Eco Tavel and Permaculture align with each other very well.

Below is a table that outlines the 12 principles of permaculture and how they can be adapted for travelling.

Our thoughts here are not designed to teach permaculture. If you are familiar with permaculture already, you may find these principles useful for thinking about how to travel in a more sustainable way.

1. **Observe and Interact**

   Take time to observe natural systems and interact with the environment to better understand how it functions and to make decisions that work in harmony with nature.

1. **Catch and Store Resources**

   Capture resources like sunlight, water, and wind when they are abundant to make them available during times of need.

1. **Obtain a Yield**

   Design systems that produce useful outputs, whether food, energy, or materials, to support sustainability and self-reliance.

| # | Principle | *explanation (classic)* |
|---|-----------|------------------------ |
| 1 | Observe and Interact | Take time to observe natural systems and interact with the environment to better understand how it functions and to make decisions that work in harmony with nature.|
|  2 | Catch and Store Resources | Capture resources like sunlight, water and wind when they are abundant to make them available during times of need. |
| 3 | Obtain a Yield | Design systems that produce useful outputs, whether food, energy, or materials, to support sustainability and self-reliance.|
| 4 | Apply Self-Regulation | Create systems with built-in checks and balances that respond to feedback, helping to avoid resource depletion and maintain balance. |
| 5 | Use Renewable Resources | Prioritize renewable materials and energy to reduce dependency on finite resources.|
| 6 | Produce No Waste | Design systems where all outputs are reused or recycled, minimizing waste.| 
| 7 | Design from Patterns to Details | Use natural patterns (e.g., water flow, seasons) to guide farm design before focusing on specifics. |
| 8 | Integrate Rather than Segregate | Create systems where elements work together, like plants and animals, for mutual benefit.|
| 9 | Use Small and Slow Solutions | Start with small, manageable systems that evolve naturally over time.|
|10 | Use and Value Diversity | Incorporate diverse plants, animals, and methods to build resilient systems.|
|11 | Use Edges and Value the Marginal | Leverage boundaries (e.g., forest edges) where diverse ecosystems create unique opportunities.|
|12 | Creatively Use and Respond to Change | Adapt to environmental or social changes with creative, flexible solutions.|

Mapping the Permaculture Principles to Eco Travel

| # | Principle | transfer to Eco Travel | transfer to Boat |
|---| --------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1 | Observe and Interact | Watch the weather. Choose local food. | Sail with the wind *but* Hide from the storm |
| 2 | Catch and Store Resources | Bottle water when you find a source. Cook while it is sunny. Boil water while it is sunny. Keep hot water in a thermos. Shop groceries while you are in civilization. Find local organic shops. Eat pizza while you can. | Sail with the wind *or* Rest in a calm |
| 3 | Obtain a Yield | Store excess energy in batteries. Share water, food and energy with others. Offer coffee. Offer help and advice. Take hitchhikers. Learn from locals. | Share the boat and offer a guest cabin |
| 4 | Apply Self-Regulation | travelling inhererently limits resources that you carry, making you constantly aware of supply and usage |
| 5 | Use Renewable Resources | *(this is why we focus on foot / bicycle / sailboat and not airplane or cruise ship)* <br> Take 'a shower' in natural bodies of water. | Boil potatoes in sea water. Clean dishes with sea water (after saving food with silicone spoon)|
| 6 | Produce No Waste | Carry paper bags for re-use in wrap-free groceries (sections). Clean dishes with silicone spoon. |
| 7 | Design from Patterns to Details | Follow the sun (seasonal migration) to eliminate the need for heating. *Plan travel routes based on natural or cultural patterns, like seasonal events or local trails.* | Plan sailing routes based on availability of usable anchorage in the destination area.|
| 8 | Integrate Rather than Segregate | Connect with locals, join community activities, or stay in shared, sustainable accommodations. | Install walkable, flexible solar panels on horizontal surfaces (no davits which add weight, windage and torque)|
| 9 | Use Small and Slow Solutions | Travel slowly, stay longer in one place to connect deeply, and reduce your footprint. |
|10 | Use and Value Diversity | Explore diverse cultures and ecosystems, supporting varied local businesses and practices.| Use sun and wind for power generation.|
|11 | Use Edges and Value the Marginal | Visit lesser-known destinations or "edge" places (e.g., coastal villages) for unique experiences. |
|12 | Creatively Use and Respond to Change | Be flexible with travel plans. Embrace spontaneity. Rest while you can. Make eye contact, meet strangers, offer coffee. Choose hobbies or work which complement travelling (e.g. indoors while raining). | Sail no matter how low the windspeed (but respect hard weather). Let the boat drift in low wind (and no obstacles).|
