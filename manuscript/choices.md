# Choices

Here is a summary of choices that follow the sustainable principles of Eco Sailing.

- - -

Based on the principle to [Use Renewable Resources](#pp05):

## Use an Electric Engine

or use no engine at all [^no_engine]

**Reasoning**: an electric engine uses energy that you have [harvested yourself](#catch-resources) from renewable resources.

In contrast, diesel and petrol are fossil fuels, which are neither renewable nor sustainable. Even if you try to use biofuels, which are renewable, I have never seen them offered in marinas. Unlike life on land, you can't produce or collect your own biofuel on board. [^biofuel_feedback]

**Bonus**:

1. producing your own electrity eliminates the dependency on fuel supply; it increases your autonomy and freedom

1. electric engines are much simpler than combustion engines; they are more reliable and they need almost no maintenance

1. electric engines are much quiet; using them feels less intrusive and more integrated with nature

We have seen electric engines winning the bicycle market. Electric engines are taking over the car market. Some markets are changing slower, perhaps because prestige or habits are stronger. But the logic is the same, and the results in sailing will be similar.

[^biofuel_feedback]: if you have experience with biofuels for your boat engine, please contact me. I would love to hear your story!

[^no_engine]: the hardcore option of ultimate simplicity; shifts [strategy](#sailing) even more to anchoring, waiting, and rowing
