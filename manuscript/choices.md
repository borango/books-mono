# Choices

Here is a summary of choices that follow the sustainable principles of Eco Sailing.

Based on the principle to [Use Renewable Resources](#pp05):

## Use an Electric Engine

or use no engine at all [^no_engine]

**Reasoning**: an electric engine uses energy that you have [harvested yourself](#catch-resources) from renewable resources.

In contrast, diesel and petrol are fossil fuels, which are neither renewable nor sustainable. Even if you try to use biofuels, which are renewable, I have never seen them offered in marinas. Unlike life on land, you can't produce or collect your own biofuel on board. [^biofuel_feedback]

**Bonus**:

1. producing your own electrity eliminates the dependency on fuel supply; it increases your autonomy and freedom

1. electric engines are much simpler than combustion engines; they are more reliable and they need almost no maintenance

1. electric engines are much quiet; using them feels less intrusive and more integrated with nature

We have seen electric engines winning the bicycle market. Electric engines are taking over the car market. Some markets are changing slower, perhaps because prestige or habits are stronger. But the logic is the same, and the results in sailing will be similar.

[^biofuel_feedback]: if you have experience with biofuels for your boat engine, please contact me. I would love to hear your story!

[^no_engine]: the hardcore option of ultimate simplicity; shifts [strategy](#sailing) even more to anchoring, waiting, and rowing

## inboard or outboard engine?

Typically the hull design of your boat will determine this question. Most larger monohulls are designed and equipped with an inboard engine and the propeller shaft going through the hull. Most smaller boats and multihulls are designed for an outboard engine, which is mounted on a transom or somewhere midships.

If you are open to major modifications, or even to choose a boat type after your engine choice, then I recommend an outboard engine for the following reasons: an outboard does not use precious interior space, does not require a vulnerable through-hull and shaft seal, and most importantly does not produce drag while sailing. Also it gives you easier options to replace the eninge if necessary, because it is not custom built or fitted inside the boat.


## light engine or strong engine?

An open question is whether to use a weaker engine, just strong enough for slow cruising speed, or a more powerful engine that can push you briefly in strong wind or current.

Personally I began with a 6 kW outboard engine on a 2-ton sailboat, which was clearly overpowered. Top speed on engine was 6.5 knots. I noticed that I never used more than 2 kW of power, and most of the time less than 500 Watts. But the 35 kg weight of the engine was often stressful to handle, because almost all of the weight sits in the bottom, near the propeller. Tilting the engine up and down was a highly physical effort and not very ergonomic either (I hurt my back a few times). I converted my first Eco Sailboat so that I could operate the engine easier.

Had the engine[^eprop_navy] worked well, then now I would have one or two of this type on my bigger Eco Sailboat (4 tons). But I had to replace the failing engine with a more reliable one, and due to limited options, I settled for two smaller but more reliable and compatible engines.

See more detailed discussion on the perfect engine in the [specialized chapter](#engine).

[^eprop_navy]: ePropulsion Navy 6 outboard engine; I do not make many product recommendations in this book, but I must warn readers of this one. Even though the hardware seems to be designed and built well, the software and electronics are sub par. The engine and battery gave me frequent warnings and stopped working many times for obscure reasons, until the engine did not work at all. Even though the distributor company did what the could, the headquarters and international support did practically not exist.
