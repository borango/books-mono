# Summary

Here is a summary of the method, with little explanation.

You can use it as a quick reference for an immediate cure (when you feel symptoms of seasickness) or while you are training the method.


## Goal: Know True Gravity

> Always *know* where the line of true gravity points to. 

This principle is a bit abstract but most important. See the following more specific principle for guidance how you can *know* True Gravity.

*Knowing* is the only possible approach, because you cannot *see* or *feel* it directly. 

There are indirect ways of *seeing*, or rather deducting the Line of Gravity, based on *sight*.

There are indirect ways of *feeling*, or rather deducting the Line of Gravity, based on *tactile* sensation.

The ultimate goal for preventing seasickness is *knowing* the Line of Gravity.

*Knowing* is possible in every situation that you might be in, and it is the key to not being seasick. Therefore, seek this knowledge. You can support this mental task with various physical exercises or strategies.

## Principle 1: Do not chain your body to the boat {#P1}

> Do not lock or couple your body to the boat structure.

Coupling your body to the boat structure would amplify the illusion of a wrong direction of gravity. 

A conflict between the Illusion of Gravity and the True Gravity makes us feel uneasy and ultimately seasick.

The tactile perception is always at work. If you put your body in a position which tells your brain a "wrong" idea of gravity, then you loose and seasickness wins.

Examples of coupling your body are:

+ sitting and leaning your back on a backrest or wall
+ standing and leaning against boat structure
+ holding on firmly with both arms, ellbows straight
+ standing with your feet wide apart and knees straight

Avoid those positions. Better positions which you can quickly adjust are:

+ sit with your upper body unlocked, and compensate boat motion with your upper body
+ don't hold on firmly to the boat. If you need to stabilize your body with your arms, then just hold on as much as you need, as little as you can, and allow your body to follow the Line of Gravity and compensate boat motion.
+ stand with your feet next to each other (like you would stand on land). Use your arms only to gently and flexibly secure your position.

A special case of your body being partially coupled to the boat is when you are laying down. It is not necessarily bad. You can feel perfectly comfortable while laying down and sleeping. We will handle this one separately.

## Principle 2: Stand Vertically {#P2}

> If your task or situation allows, then stand up. 

This is the best way to follow Principle 1.

A good example of a suitable situation is in the helm. If you have the choice between sitting or standing, and you tend to feel seasick, then stand up. With wheel steering you can typically stand up. With tiller steering, you can stand up if you have a tiller extension installed. You can improvise a tiller extension with rope (obviously only for pulling the tiller, not for pushing).

If you have no current task to do, then stand up.

Stand as vertical as you can. Don't spread your legs excessively, since that would lock at least your lower body (legs and hips) with the boat structure, and thus violate princple #2.

Do not hold on firmly with your arms, as this would lock your upper body (or the whole body) with the boat structure.

Standing up without locking your body to the boat will automatically result in your vertical body to aling with the line of True Gravity (otherwise you would fall). When your body aligns with the line of True Gravity, you automatically *know* where gravity points to, and the goal #1 is achieved. This is why Standing Vertically is the most useful exercise and capability against seasickness. It works perfectly to prevent seasickness, and it helps a lot as an immediate cure in case of seasickness symptoms.

At first, it seems counter-intuitive to let go of the boat structure. Intuitively it seems to be safer if you hold on firmly or lean against something solid. But our intuition was not made for sailing, and it is a bad  advisor in this situation.

You can hold on gently with one hand to something solid, like the mast or boom or a handle. If you do, make sure that your arm is bent and flexible. You arm shall constantly compensate the distance between your truly vertical body and the boat's structure. The goal here is to hold on only as much as necessary, and as little as possible. Often your grip is just a safety measure: you apply zero force but have your hand in secure place where you can firmly hold on if you needed (when you get surprise by a wave or any other unexpteced boat motion).


## Principle 3: Sit with free-floating upper body

> When you need to sit, then at least allow your upper body to "float freely", i.e. do not lock your upper body.

This is the second-best way to follow [Principle #1](#P1).

When sitting, your lower body (feet, legs, hips) are already locked.

Leaning your back to a backrest or wall would also lock your upper body. The effectively your whole body is locked, which is the worst possible violation of principle #2.

Holding on with your arms firmly, while sitting, is another way of locking your body, and you should avoid that too.

From life at land, in a house, in your car, at the office, we are very much used to lean our backs onto something. As a preparation for sailing without seasickness, I like to practice sitting with my free upper body whenever I can.

If you allow your upper body to float freely, then you will most likely compensate boat movements with your upper body, because it minimizes the effort in your muscles. You upper body will align with the line of gravity. This way, your brain is aware and knows the line of true gravity. Goal #1 achieved.

A variation of this principle is to sit with your eyes closed, and let your upper body compensate boat motion. This can be more challenging because you remove visual clues (horizon). It could also be useful, in case you don't have healthy visual clues, like below deck without a window.
Only perform this variation when you are feeling perfectly well, because closing your eyes could increase the chance of seasickness.
When there is no boat motion, then there is no point in this exercise.

## Ex 1: Surf the boat

This is a variation of principle #2, Stand Vertically. Boat surfing can be a fun exercise and an intermediate step in your training for standing vertically.

The difference between Boat Surfing and Standing Vertically is this: in Boat Surfing, you spread your legs and bend your knees slightly, similar to a surfing stance. Do not hold on to anything. Just like in surfing, compensate boat motion primarily with your upper body, and also with the help of your arms as countering weights, and with the angles of your knees. 

It might seem foolish to use the boat like a surfboard. Take it like a game and embrace your inner child.

Choose a safe location for this exercise. If boat motion destabilizes you, then you must have safe options for kneeling down or, in the worst case, for falling.

This exercise has no practical application in sailing, it is merely a fun activity which should culminate in your ability to Stand Vertically.

Even when you are fairly good at Standing Vertically, you can play a round of boatsurfing e.g. in rough seastate.

While you are boat-surf as an active exercise, you will be very focussed and completely aware of the line of True Gravity. Therefore, this exercise does not only help to devlop your sense of True Gravity, but also works as an immediate cure in case when symptoms are striking.

Standing vertically is like surfing the boat, just with minimal compensating movements, mostly in your ankles.


## Ex 2: Stand on One Leg

Another playful variation of principle #2, Stand Vertically.

Standing upright on one leg is already a bit of a challenge even on land. If you haven't done that in a while (since your childhood?) then now is a good time to start practicing it.

Begin with standing on both legs, feet closed. Then gently lift on foot just enough that it does not touch the ground. Stand as straight and vertically as you can. Your body might move and compensate a bit more in the beginning. You motion system will soon adjust, and you will notice that it takes only micro adjustments for you to stand on one leg.

Of couse you should not hold on to anything, at least not firmly. On land, where the ground is not moving at all, you can safely practice without holding on to anything. While sailing, you might use one hand for a safety grip, but with zero force normally - just to prevent falling in case of unexpteced instability.

This exercise has no practical application in sailing, it is merely a fun activity which should culminate in your ability to Stand Vertically.

A further variation of Standing on One Leg is to do it with your eyes closed. This is more challenging because you remove visual clues. Only perform this variation when you are feeling perfectly well, because closing your eyes could increase the chance of seasickness.


## Remedy 1: Look at the Horizon

This one is probably the most popular advice against seasickness, and it certainly works.

Looking at the horizon is a visual clue where the true horizontal plane really is - hence the name. 

Technically that goes very well with keeping a watch. Watchkeeping can be a challege for a completely different reason: the responsibility for the watchkeep could create psychological pressure, especially if conditions like wind and seastate are challenging. If you feel symptoms of seasickness while keeping your watch, and another member of the crew is available or on stand-by, then you could hand over the watch and experiment with looking at the horizon as your only task. If that makes a difference, then likely the watchkeeping responsibility made a difference.

Below deck you can seek a window and look at the horizon.

The floors and decks of the boat are just an illusion for "horizontal". If you focus on those, you amplify the illusion of a wrong direction of gravity. It happens automatically, unfortunately. Looking at the horizon is one way to correct that illusion. True gravity is always perpendicular to the horizon. Our brain knows that instinctively. That is why *looking at the horizon* is enough, the sense of True Gravity will automatically follow.

You can combine *looking* and *feeling*: Stand vertically while looking that the horizon, or boatsurf while looking at the horizon. You should always combine all possible visual and tactile clues you can get, especially in an acute state of seasickness.


## Remedy 2: Don't Look Down

This is obviously one of many negations of the horizon-looking principle. 

Looking down is the worst visual clue that you can choose when the boat is moving. Sometimes you can's avoid it, especially if you have to perform certain tasks (cleaning, bilge-pumping, putting on or off your shoes / socks / pants).

If you start feeling symptoms while looking down, then stop whatever you do, look at the horizon if it is visible, or at least put your head in the best possible vertical position.

## Remedy 3: Stand Vertically

If you do not stand vertically already, then change your body position to stand vertically. 

This is [Principle #2](#P2) applied as an immediate remedy.

## Remedy 4: Sit free-floating

If you cannot stand up, because your are below deck, or because of extreme seastate, then allow your upper body to "float freely".

This is [Principle #3](#principle-3-sit-with-free-floating-upper-body) applied as an immediate remedy.
