## Sunlight

*renewable resource*

A highly available resource which we often connect to electric energy. While [solar panels](#solar_panels) are a great application for catching sunlight and converting it to electric energy. I value and use it a lot.

If the goal of a particular activity is heating / boiling / cooking, however, then the most efficient way to use sunlight is to catch its infrared component, and use that as heat directly.

For me the most impressive way of doing that are [solar stoves](#solar_stove). I use [hot water](#hot-water) daily (2 liters estimated). When the batteries are not 100% full, I heat all water in solar stoves and keep it in [thermos cans](#thermos).

In theory, cooking on solar follows the same logic: heat food with sunlight. I do that frequently but I must admit: it is a different kind of cooking. Not all recipes work equally well, it is generally slower than a pan or a pot, and you need to learn new techniques. More on that in its [own chapter](#solar_stove).

The greatest advantage of solar cooking is that it consumes no fuel and no battery capacity.

Another elegant yet luxury application of heat from sunlight is the [solar shower](#solar_shower). Downside: it consumes water. But if you would use that anyway for skincare, then catching the desired heat from sunlight is certainly clever.

The most natural way of enjoying sunlight is certainly just letting it shine on your skin. Boatlife gives you plently opportunities for doing so.
