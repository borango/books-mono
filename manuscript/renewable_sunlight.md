## Sunlight

A highly available resource which we often associate with electric energy. [solar panels](#solar-panels) are a great application for catching sunlight and converting it to electric energy. I value and use it a lot.

If the goal of a particular activity is heating / boiling / cooking, however, then the most efficient way to use sunlight is to catch its infrared component, and use that as heat directly.

For me the most impressive way of doing that are [solar stoves](#solar-stove). I use [hot water](#hot-water) daily (2-3 liters estimated). When the batteries are not 100% full, I heat all water in solar stoves and keep it in [thermos cans](#thermos).

In theory, cooking on solar follows the same logic: heat food with sunlight. I do that frequently but I must admit: it is a different kind of cooking. Not all recipes work equally well, it is generally slower than a pan or a pot, and you need to learn new techniques. More on that in its [own chapter](#solar-stove).

The greatest advantage of solar cooking is that it consumes no fuel and no battery capacity.

Another elegant yet luxury application of heat from sunlight is the [solar shower](#solar-shower). Downside: it consumes water. But if you would use that anyway for skincare, then catching the desired heat from sunlight is certainly clever.
