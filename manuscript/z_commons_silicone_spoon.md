## Silicone Spoon (or Spatula)

For those who have been using it for a while, this is a fundamental helper in the kitchen - be it on a travel or at home.

Most of us know the silicone spoon as a one-trick-pony, but it can do so much more than just remove dough from a bowl. In Eco Travel, we use the silicone spoon after every single meal to clean the dishes as much as possible. It serves two purposes: preventing food waste and saving water.

When fresh water is limited, certainly while hiking, perhaps also in your car or boat, then you want to avoid wasting it. Using these techniques, I could travel the Moroccan Sahara for 2 weeks with only 1 liter of water per day.

### Use

Adopting the silicone spoon requires a change of your habits. Instead of rinsing your plate with soap and lots of water, you use the silicone spoon to scrape off any remaining food - especially oily or sticky substances. After this pre-cleaning, you can wash the dishes with a minimal amount of water. 

You can even go further and drink the water which you just used for final cleaning.

> Wait - you drink your dishwater?

Yes I do. Just 5 minutes earlier this has been my meal. A healthy one I might add. Here is another change in habits: when you wash dishes a long time after your meal, then yes, they will begin to stick and perhaps smell. This is where we learned, correctly, that used dishes are not exactly hygienic. Quite differently immediately after a meal. Scraping dishes, finishing with a little water and then drinking it is perfectly fine. A liquid version of the meal which you had 5 minutes ago.

### Where not to use

Avoid very sharp edges, like the opening of a tin can, or a knife obviously. They will cut the silicone.

### Which to buy

You can find silicone spoons in most supermarkets, in various sizes and shapes. The perfect shape is very flexible. Sometimes the handle stick makes it stiffer than it should be - avoid that shape.

The best size is a bit larger than a tea spoon - small enough to fit in your mouth. This fits personal dishes perfectly. It requires a bit more work to clean pots and pans. If you can have two, then I recommend a larger one for pots and pans, and a smaller one for personal dishes. If you can only have one (hiking), then the smaller one is the most versatile.
