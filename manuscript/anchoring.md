# Anchoring

The secret superpower of Eco Sailing, and the rather steady complement to active [sailing](#sailing)

Anchoring can be a quick emergency measure for stopping the boat, a planned stop for one night, or a long-term stay in a lagoon or river.

Because Eco Sailing shifts priorities from engine to anchor, and also from marinas to anchor, it only makes sense to be well prepared for anchoring.

Besides the main anchor, I suggest that you have a second anchor ready at the bow, and a third anchor ready at the stern.

Practice the deployment and retrieval of all anchors in easy conditions, so that deployment succeeds with little risk and effort. This reduces stress for planned anchor maneuvers, and it is essential for emergency anchoring.
