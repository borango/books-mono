## No Cooking At All

### Trail Mix 

also known as: MÃ©lange Montagnarde (fr) / Studentenfutter (de)

[Sunflower Seeds](#sunflower-seeds) + [Raisins](#raisins)

Extend or replace your favourite fruits, seeds and nuts. I find the above the most versatile also for other recipes.

Time to prepare: just go to the galley.

### Energy Snack

[Peanut Butter](#peanut-butter) + [Raisins](#raisins)


### Seaweed Salad

Highly depends on seewead availability. I never plan this dish but prepare it when I happen to catch seaweed, typically on the anhor chain.

Seaweed + [soy sauce](#soy-sauce), or [mustard](#mustard) + [olive oil](#olive-oil)

10 minutes for cleaning (from sand) and cutting / ripping to pieces +  
5 minutes for the vinaigrette

## Just add Hot Water

Based on [hot water](#hot-water), which I recommend to have always ready on the Eco Sailboat, these are very quick meals to prepare:

### Ramen

The classic, no comment...

5 minutes

### Porridge

Pour hot water over [oatmeal](#oatmeal) and [raisins](#raisins). Let both soak (raisins will inflate and get soft). Add [sunflower seeds](#sunflower-seeds), [peanut butter](#peanut-butter) and [sprouts](#sprouts). Diced apple goes well with it, if you have. Add instant coffee or cacao for the taste, if you like.

Sometimes I eat it as a breakfast, sometimes as a desert, or just as a quick meal.

5 minutes to mix,
