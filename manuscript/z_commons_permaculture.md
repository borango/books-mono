## Classic Permaculture Principles


| # | Principle | *explanation (classic)* | in this book |
|---|-----------|------------------------ | ------------ |
| 1 | Observe and Interact []{#pp01} | Take time to observe natural systems and interact with the environment to better understand how it functions and to make decisions that work in harmony with nature.|
| 2 | Catch and Store Resources []{#pp02} | Capture resources like sunlight, water and wind when they are abundant to make them available during times of need. | [Catch](#catch-resources), [Store Resources](#store-resources), [Store Food](#store-food)
| 3 | Obtain a Yield []{#pp03} | Design systems that produce useful outputs, whether food, energy, or materials, to support sustainability and self-reliance.|
| 4 | Apply Self-Regulation []{#pp04} | Create systems with built-in checks and balances that respond to feedback, helping to avoid resource depletion and maintain balance. |
| 5 | Use Renewable Resources []{#pp05} | Prioritize renewable materials and energy to reduce dependency on finite resources.|
| 6 | Produce No Waste []{#pp06} | Design systems where all outputs are reused or recycled, minimizing waste.| 
| 7 | Design from Patterns to Details []{#pp07} | Use natural patterns (e.g., water flow, seasons) to guide farm design before focusing on specifics. |
| 8 | Integrate Rather than Segregate []{#pp08} | Create systems where elements work together, like plants and animals, for mutual benefit.|
| 9 | Use Small and Slow Solutions []{#pp09} | Start with small, manageable systems that evolve naturally over time. |
|10 | Use and Value Diversity []{#pp10} | Incorporate diverse plants, animals, and methods to build resilient systems.|
|11 | Use Edges and Value the Marginal []{#pp11} | Leverage boundaries (e.g., forest edges) where diverse ecosystems create unique opportunities.|
|12 | Creatively Use and Respond to Change []{#pp12} | Adapt to environmental or social changes with creative, flexible solutions.|
