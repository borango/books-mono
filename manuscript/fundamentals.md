# Fundamentals (WIP)

No matter which type of transportation, a few topics are always relevant:

1. clothes
1. drinks
1. food
1. shelter
1. energy
1. communication

These topics are related. For example, hot water requires energy input and supports both the preparation of drinks (tea, coffee) and food (porridge, instant soup, ramen noodles, rice, pasta, potatoes).

When weight or space is limited, I find it a good compromise to heat water and prepare simple meals, instead of cooking fancy dishes.
