# Catch Resources

Space and weight on a boat is limited. Catching resources from the environment is essential.


## catch wind with Sails for propulsion {#sails}

First things first. A sailboat is a boat with sails as the primary means of propulsion.

Adding an engine to a sailboat is convenient but not necessary. This sounds like an old-school, retro opinion. Many recreational sailors disagree. More on the engine habits in the chapter on [sailing](#sailing).

For the purpose of Eco Sailing, I consider the sails by far as the most important resource catcher on a sailboat. If you look at the math and physics, sails are by far the most powerful system on a boat. So powerful in fact that we often reduce their power by reefing.

Historically, sails were the *only* means of propulsion on a boat. Only in the last century, engines became available and common. For thousands of years, merchants and fishermen and pessengers travelled the seas with sails only. While I am totally open for all opportunities that modern technology offers, I want to point out that it is perfectly viable to view sails as the standard, and the engine as auxiliary.

Compared to an engine, sails are direct resource-catchers. This simplicity is not only elegant. It is the reason for high reliability, excellent maintainability [^maintainability] and a relatively intuitive use.

[^maintainability]: the ability to keep in good condition, and to repair it yourself if broken


## catch wind with a Turbine for electricity {#wind-turbine}

The other way to catch wind: turning it into electric energy. More on the wind turbine in the chapter on [Electro Backbone](#electro-backbone).
