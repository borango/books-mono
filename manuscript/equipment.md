# Equipment (summary) {#equipment}

> everything that we carry or install on the boat, I call *equipment*.

Equipment is always a means to an end, such as Catching or Storing Resources or Cooking. Therefore I have sorted the detailed description of most pieces of equipment into those sections.

Here is a complete list of equipment from this book.
