# Store Resources

This section is derived from [Permaculture principle #2 Catch and Store Resources](#pp02).

It follows logically from the need to use resources (food, water, energy) not in the same moment when you [catch](#catch-resources) or produce them.

In this book I am dividing storage of *food* from all other resources (water and energy).

This section here is about the "other" resources.
