### Boran

Rock climber, paragliding pilot, sailor and engineer. Converted sailboats to 100% green energy for sustainable, autonomous life.

Fascinated by complexity and by strategies to master it - on one side. On the other side, loves simplicity and minimalism.

Loves people, dogs and nature.

Believes in freedom and peace.
