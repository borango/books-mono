A> Boran's note:
My experience comes from 10 years of driving an electric vehicle. My travels took me North of the Arctic circle (twice) and to the Morroccan Sahara (twice). In the second 5 years I used to roof tent which had been a perfect extension in space and comfort.

## Electric Vehicle

For the sake of the environment, electric propulsion is most likely the most sustainable option. An electric vehicle is not necessarily powered by batteries. You can consider a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle as well, which also results in zero emissions and avoids the resource issues of lithium batteries.

### Budget

Depending how and where you source your electricity, it can come at very low cost. 10 years ago many providers were offering free charging stations, and some still do. Boran had been lucky to have a car contract that includes lifetime free electric charging. In Morrocco most charging stations are free of cost since 2019, until 2024 at least. At home you could charge from your own solar power, as Flo does.

In general we assume that the future price of electricity is more predictable than the price of gasoline or diesel.

Access to a (fast) electric charging station may be limited in certain regions, particularly in less wealthy parts of the world. Charging station coverage typically follows the market of EV sales.

On the simplest end of electrical installation (230 Volt), an EV has actually more charging options than a petrol car. All you need to find is a standard power outlet. Because it is slow, charging over night makes most sense. Therefore, charging at some sort of accomodation is ideal. Boran has travelled the Sahara part of Morrocco in 2019 in this style: requesting a bed and breakfast with a power outlet, or checking on a campsite that electricity is actually available.

In the long run, cheaper costs of electricity can compensate the higher initial purchase price, making an electric vehicle actually the less expensive choice.

## Roof Tent

If your car is smaller than a typical recreational vehicle or camper and you wish for more space, then I can only recommend a root tent. It is relatively inexpensive (compared to buying a larger vehicle) and compatible with most cars or trucks. That simplifies the investment decision, because you can add a roof tent to your existing car now, and carry it over to a new car or truck later.

Also you can remove the roof tent from your car if you are not travelling full-time.

Depending on the size of your travelling crew, and on your travel patterns, you can choose from many different construction options. 

Foldable roof tents provide for the largest possible space, because the sleeping area is twice the size of the folded area. The disadvantages are:
+ needs more time for packing
+ needs extra space on one side of your car for unfolding (no issue in nature, limits options in urban areas such as parking lots)
+ has a bit bulkier profile and worse aerodynamics when folded, compared to a hard shell roof tent
