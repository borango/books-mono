## Hot Water

Fundamental for drinks and food: having hot water available is at the core of the Eco Travel kitchen.

With hot water, you can prepare tea and coffee. You can also prepare (I don't want to say "cook") porridge, instant noodles, instant soup, boiled eggs, taboule and other instant meals. You can also use it to wash dishes and to wash your hair.

You can prepare and carry hot water in a any mode of transportation: on foot, and even easier in a vehicle.

Boiling water requires quite some energy (200 Wh per liter, see chapter on [Energy](#energy)). Therefore it is best to keep hot water, that you do not use immediately, in a thermos. This aligns with the Permaculture Principle [#2 Catch and Store Resources](#pp02).

Three liters of hot water contain the same amount of energy which is equivalent to half of a standard car battery. Imagine that: boiling 3 liters of water will empty half of your car battery. 

Or in other words: keeping 3 liters of hot water is like installing an additional half car battery. It is the cheapest way of extending your energy storage capacity.

### Required Equipment

#### always

1. Thermos (to store hot water until you need it)

#### one or more of the following for heating (in order of sustainability):

1. solar stove (mainly in car or boat, also possible for hiking)

1. 12 Volt immersion heater (in car or boat)

1. wood stove (solo stove, or similar) for hiking or camping

1. compact gas stove (fossil but fast and versatile)

Clearly the most elegant solution for heating water is with direct sunlight, using a solar stove. It works best when you are stationary. While driving, sailing or swinging around an anchor it might be impossible.

A solar stove takes time to boil water - approximately 40 to 80 minutes in direct sunlight for heating all of its content, which is depending on the stove size 0.4 to 3 liters. When you are stationary you can place the solar stove in the evening so that it will catch the morning sun, and you can harvest the hot water once to slip out of your sleeping bag.

During the day I boil several rounds of water in the solar stove and keep it in a thermos. This way you always have quick access to hot water, and still require no electricity, wood or gas. Bingo.

For bicycle travel, I find the solar stove the best possible heating option.

The second most efficient way to boil water is with a 12 Volt immersion heater directly in your thermos bottle (car and boat only).

This will work in a car, but please be aware that it will drain your car battery quickly. In an electric car this is less of a problem. Otherwise use the immersion heater carefully while you are driving and the engine is running anyway. In stationary use with your car, and if you have solar panels to charge your 12 V system, then you can still dedicate electric energy for boiling water (relatively quickly) and replenish the battery with the help of the solar panel.

On a boat you are likely less limited in electric energy, and as an Eco Traveller you also have enough solar panels installed. When the batteries on my boat are fully charged then I use the immersion heater as my first choice, otherwise the solar stove.

You can shorten the time to boil water by starting with warm water that you kept from the previous day. On the sailboat I routinely boil water in the 2 liter thermos in the afternoon, and use (perhaps re-heat) that for the rest of the day and the next morning.

A small and efficient wood stove, like a Solo Stove, uses a renewable fuel that comes for free. Plus the wood stove can not only boil water but also cook a real meal. It is great for hiking and for bicycle travel. Obviously it requires careful handling, it produces smoke and requires cleaning after use. The total manual time to boil water (or cook a meal) is larger than in the other options.

A compact and efficient gas stove, such as the Primus Lite, is the fastest and most universal way to boil water or even cook. The biggest drawback is that it uses a fossil fuel that is not renewable. I am listing it here anyway because of its great utility.

When electric capacity was limited and sunlight not available, then I would use the gas stove as a backup. If we look at it from a *Fair Share* perspective, I would say that it is acceptable to use a gas stove after the other options have been exhausted.

On my current sailboat setup this is not an issue anymore, and now I have not used the gas stove since a year.

Even when you don't have the means to heat water yourself, you can still bring hot water with you. You can buy or get hot water for free in many places, such as cafes, restaurants, hotels or from your couchsurfing hosts.
