## Solar Panels

A great opportunity on a boat, even better on a catamaran, is the available space for mounting solar panels.

They catch [sunlight](#sunlight), an endless renewable resource, and follow the [Permaculture principle #2](#pp02) (Catch and Store Resources).

Together with a modern charge controller, solar panels also implement the [principle of self-regulation](#pp04). If configured correctly, they will never over-charge your battery or overload your DC circuit.
