Mapping the Permaculture Principles to Eco Travel

| # | Principle | transfer to Eco Travel | transfer to Boat |
|---| --------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1 | Observe and Interact | Watch the weather. Choose local food. | Sail with the wind *but* Hide from the storm |
| 2 | Catch and Store Resources | Bottle water when you find a source. Cook while it is sunny. Boil water while it is sunny. Keep hot water in a thermos. Shop groceries while you are in civilization. Find local organic shops. Eat pizza while you can. | Sail with the wind *or* Rest in a calm |
| 3 | Obtain a Yield | Store excess energy in batteries. Share water, food and energy with others. Offer coffee. Offer help and advice. Take hitchhikers. Learn from locals. | Share the boat and offer a guest cabin |
| 4 | Apply Self-Regulation | travelling inhererently limits resources that you carry, making you constantly aware of supply and usage |
| 5 | Use Renewable Resources | *(this is why we focus on foot / bicycle / sailboat and not airplane or cruise ship)* <br> Take 'a shower' in natural bodies of water. | Boil potatoes in sea water. Clean dishes with sea water (after saving food with silicone spoon)|
| 6 | Produce No Waste | Carry paper bags for re-use in wrap-free groceries (sections). Clean dishes with silicone spoon. |
| 7 | Design from Patterns to Details | Follow the sun (seasonal migration) to eliminate the need for heating. *Plan travel routes based on natural or cultural patterns, like seasonal events or local trails.* | Plan sailing routes based on availability of usable anchorage in the destination area.|
| 8 | Integrate Rather than Segregate | Connect with locals, join community activities, or stay in shared, sustainable accommodations. | Install walkable, flexible solar panels on horizontal surfaces (no davits which add weight, windage and torque)|
| 9 | Use Small and Slow Solutions | Travel slowly, stay longer in one place to connect deeply, and reduce your footprint. |
|10 | Use and Value Diversity | Explore diverse cultures and ecosystems, supporting varied local businesses and practices.| Use sun and wind for power generation.|
|11 | Use Edges and Value the Marginal | Visit lesser-known destinations or "edge" places (e.g., coastal villages) for unique experiences. |
|12 | Creatively Use and Respond to Change | Be flexible with travel plans. Embrace spontaneity. Rest while you can. Make eye contact, meet strangers, offer coffee. Choose hobbies or work which complement travelling (e.g. indoors while raining). | Sail no matter how low the windspeed (but respect hard weather). Let the boat drift in low wind (and no obstacles).|
