# Sailing

For the purpose of this book's structure, I discuss everything related to actively moving the boat as *sailing*.

## Propulsion

For moving the boat we typically have two options: [sails](#sails) and the [engine](#engine), both discussed in their own chapters.

Here I want to compara and connect these propulsion options with the strategy and tactics of navigation.

Eco Sailing limits the engine options effectively to an electric one, by [choice](#choice).
While you can get them at any power that you desire, the autonomy of an electric engine is limited by the installed battery capacity. Practically that means that you cannot go as fast or as far with an electric engine, compared to a combustion engine.

For a longer sailing trip (one or multiple days), my cruising speed on engine is between 1 and 2 knots. It is barely better than standing still.

This implies that I will use the sails whenever they accelerate the boat to 2 knots or above.

I appreciate my electric engine in these situations:
1. approaching or leaving a coast that blocks offshore wind
1. maneuvering in an anchorage (or marina) with little space or no wind
1. keep going at least slowly, in a calm

My current electric engines have 3kW combined power, for a boat of 5 tons displacement. Many would call that underpowered. It certainly rules out the engine to solve following problems:

1. going somewhere fast, without wind
1. going straight into strong headwind
1. going against strong current, without wind
1. using the engine for simplicity in strong wind
1. ... in particular on harbour entry

How do you solve these problems with little or no engine power?

Similar to "the old days" of sailing, the answers are simple:

1. wait for wind
1. tack, or (anchor and) wait for wind from a more favourable direction, or change your route
1. (anchor and) wait for current to turn, or change your route
1. reef the sails, or (anchor and) wait for wind to calm down. Practice sailing in strong wind to improve your technical skills and mental confidence.
1. ... in particular on harbour entry; enter under sail or anchor outside or keep sailing

> **Eco Sailing shifts the problem solving strategies to [anchoring](#anchoring), waiting and active sailing**

Eco Sailing works better when you are not on a schedule, when you are not bound by time or "deadlines" (what a terrible word). It works perfectly for me, living on the boat full time, cruising slowly whenever I want but never in a hurry.

When you look around in a marina and check for boats without an engeine, you will find mostly very small boats, like sailing dinghys or beach catamarans.


## Navigation

By navigation I mean the strategy and tactics of sailing. This includes route planning, weather routing, using charts and instruments - all the theoretical aspects. I separate it from steering and sail handling, which are practical consequences of navigation decisions. Navigation depends on current and forecasted conditions. Because conditions change, navigation is a continuous process.

Mostly because of the propulsion facts and choices,

## Steering

1. hand steering
1. autohelm steering
1. windvane steering

## Sail Handling

1. setting sails
1. trimming sails
1. reefing sails
1. dropping sails
