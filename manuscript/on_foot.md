Boran's note:
> With mountain hiking I have some experience. Mostly for hike&fly and vol-biv paragliding.
> In paragliding, the choice of gear is very special to the activity and not representative for a larger audience. Because of the weight of the paraglider, I often chose to sacrifice some cooking or sleeping comfort for weight savings, where most people on most hikes would carry more food and gear for cooking or sleeping. Therefore, para-mountaineering could be considered another minimalist activity even though there may be more than 10 kg of weight to carry.
