# On Foot

Boran's note:
> Flo is the minimalist expert here

Boran's note:
> Boran has some experience with mountain hiking, mostly for hike&fly and vol-biv paragliding.
> With paragliding, the choice of gear is very special to the activity and not representativ for a larger audience. Because of the weight of the paraglider, I often chose to sacrifice some cooking comfort for weight savings where most people on most hikes would carry more food and cooking gear. Therefore, para-mountaineering could be considered another minimalist activity.
