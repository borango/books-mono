# a little science of Energy {#energy}

If we want to manage and conserve energy, we need to develop an understanding of energy amounts.

How much energy to move a car for a mile? How much energy to cook pasta for two?  How much energy to heat a room for an hour? To boil a liter of water?

| what | how much | notes |
| ---  | ---      | ---   |
| boil water | 10 liters | from 20° to 100° Celsius |
| drive an electric car | 5 kilometers | *at about 100 km/h, depends on the car of course* |
| move a boat (slowly) | 10 nautical miles | *at about 2-3 knots, depends a lot on the boat, wind and current* |

To be honest: before I began driving an electric car, I did not have a clue how much energy is stored in a tank of gasoline, and how much energy is needed for cooking pasta. These things did not have to do anything with each other. They did not seem to have a common unit. I topped up my car and paid for the gasoline per liter. I cooked pasta, and while I knew roughly the price of electricity, but I certainly did not calculate the amount of energy or its price for a pasta meal.

For me this behaviour of passive energy consumption changed when I installed the cables and planned for the daily charging need of my first electric car. I charged it at home, so the car's energy consumption and the domestic energy consumption were now related. I estimated the total daily, monthly and annual consumptions. Also I changed the electricity provider to an 100% renewable one, because now energy consumption was part of my active decision making.

This topic is somewhat scientific and mathematical in nature. After all, we need to calculate power and energy when we make decisions about how many solar panels to install, and how large a battery to buy. 

But I will keep everything simple and practical. My explanation format here is hybrid: I will explain the mathematical facts so that we will be able to actually calculate, and I will give intuitive analgies that you will mostl likely recognize from your daily life.

> There is no need to be frustrated if you do not find the mathematics intuitive. I must admit: I still do not find it intuitive myself. But I have learned to use it, and now it is almost second nature to me. It is a bit like using a computer: you do not need to understand how it works inside. As long as you can start it up, use the browser or a text editor or an email program, it is a success.



### Energy, Power and Time

Hiking up a hill requires a certain amount of energy for my body. The energy is transmitted to the muscles as blood sugar. Sooner or later I replentisch the energy by eating food.

Hiking up a in 30 minutes requires twice the power than hiking up the same hill in one hour. My body can clearly feel the difference. I need to breathe harder and my face may turn red. The total consumed energy is the same, but the time and power is different.

Here is the abstract formula which relates energy (E), power (P) and time (t):

$$E = P \cdot t$$



### Energy Units

A typical unit of power is the Watt (W). 

Some examples: a smartphone operates at a few Watts. A laptop computer around 30 Watts. An electric cooking stove operates between 800 and 2000 Watts.

A car that accelerates or drives as high speed operates perhaps at 100 "Horse Powers" (HP), which is about 70 Kilowatts (70 thousand Watts). 

The human brain operates at 30 Watts - what a mighty and efficient computer we have there!

Now, Energy is Power multiplied by Time. So, if we use the unit Watt for Power, we can express Energy in Watt hours (Wh).

A practical unit for the amount of energy is the kilowatt hour (kWh) [^kwh]. It is the amount of energy that *something* with a power of 1 kW consumes in one hour.


[^kwh]: actually the official scientific unit is Watt Seconds (Ws), or Joule, but this is not very practical for daily use. 1 kWh = 3.6 megajoule.
